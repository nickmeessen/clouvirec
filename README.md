## NO LONGER MAINTAINED! #

> ## tl;dr ##
> **Clouvirec is a web front-end written in Ruby on Rails for SickBeard. Squeezed into a Facebook App.**

This project started out as a service for friends of mine, I ended up squeezing it into a Facebook App. People could select as many TV shows as they'd like and the backend powered by <http://sickbeard.com> and <http://thetvdb.com> would handle the data management. Facebook Users would receive a notify whenever new episode has aired, friends of mine had the privelege to even download the episodes from my server.

Eventually I moved my other webservices over to the cloud, and this was the only service residing on my VPS. Financially it wasn't beneficiary anymore, so I deciced to axe this project.

I did make a little plain HTML/JS demo which is hosted here <http://www.nickmeessen.nl/clouvirec>, to show off the UI :-)
